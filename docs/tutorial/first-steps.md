# First Steps

## Installation

If you haven't done so already, you can install Sovereign via pip

```
pip install sovereign
```

## Configuration

The main things you'll need in order to run Sovereign are:

* [Sources](/terminology/#sources)
* [Templates](/terminology/#templates)

Start by creating an somewhat empty YAML configuration file at the location `/etc/sovereign.yaml`

```yaml
sources: []
templates: {}
```

See the full list of [Settings and Environment Variables](/settings/)
