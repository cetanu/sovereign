{# ------------- Zone-Aware Load-balancing Local Clusters -------------

   Explanation of this block of configuration:

     Zone-Aware load-balancing in Envoy requires that the source and destination
     clusters have the same number of zones.

     We have a configured list of regions where proxies are deployed, so we
     make a fake "cluster" in each region.

     Elsewhere, in other templates, we create endpoints with the same number
     of zones, so that envoy knows to use zone-aware load-balancing.

     If the proxy (configured with --service-zone) and the upstream have the
     same zone, Envoy will priotize traffic to it
