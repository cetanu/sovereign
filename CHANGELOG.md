Changelog
=========

0.1.20 2019-05-27
-----------------

* Changed /healthcheck endpoint to test rendering a random template type, instead of all of them, per execution

0.1.19 2019-05-23
-----------------

* Bugfix: if sources retrieved by sovereign aren't loadable as a dict, they will be skipped and a warning will be logged

0.1.18 2019-03-29
-----------------

* Add configuration options to specify port and constant tags for Statsd metrics

0.1.17 2019-03-22
-----------------

* Bugfix: an envoy without an ipv4 key in metadata would receive errors in response to a discovery request
* Return a customizable HTTP response code on 'cached' responses (i.e. responses with no changes)
  The default is 304, which at present causes Envoy to consider the request failed. Setting this to 504 will avoid
  emitting logs and metrics that indicate a failure, but will increase the 5xx statistics of the cluster.
  The option can be set in the config via `no_changes_response_code`
* werkzeug.contrib.cache has been deprecated in favor of cachelib, so we are now using the latter.

0.1.16 2019-02-19
-----------------

* Restructured the package init so that it doesn't throw an exception if config hasn't been supplied via environment variable
* The app will only emit metrics for request paths that are used for discovery

0.1.15 2019-01-25
-----------------

* Removed and simplified the repository by removing Atlassian specific items
* Updated documentation and associated release process

0.1.14 2019-01-25
-----------------
* Changes to an Atlassian-related Modifier. Going to try to remove this at some stage.
