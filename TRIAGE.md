Issue triage policy
===================

The purpose of this document is to define the process for triaging, responding
to and actioning issues and contributions.

---

The project author/owner will primarily respond to issues and contributions on
an ad-hoc basis.

If the issue/pull-request contains a serious problem or opportunity respectively,
which require significant effort, the work will be delegated to project maintainers.
The work will be prioritized within the author's team within Atlassian, and an 
appropriate due-date will be set if it can be determined. The due-date will be
communicated with the party that submitted the issue/contribution.
